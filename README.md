# VAattribution_round2
This repository holds scripts for VA's tolerance document/attribution workshop for fish and macroinvertebrates. 

This piece of the project goes over all data organization steps to combine Virginia DEQ, WVA DEP, MD, and Fairfax environmental, macroinvertebrate, and fish datasets into as single dataset to run CDF, GAM, and species distribution analyses. A Shiny App allows users to easily navigate through all the statistics for the taxa identified. Scripts for the project are archived here, but due to the size and nature of the data, the plots and data are not stored on GitHub.
